Below is a practical, end-to-end plan for building a fraud-detection system for financial transactions using Generative AI (GenAI) combined with traditional ML. It covers data, features, model choices (including where GenAI adds value), training and evaluation, deployment, monitoring, privacy, and example code and prompt templates you can copy into a repository to get started.

High-level summary
- Use GenAI where it helps: feature engineering, synthetic data generation, explanation and analyst-assist (narrative summarization and triage), and fraud pattern discovery.
- Combine GenAI with robust supervised models (gradient boosting, neural nets) and graph-based methods for relational/fraud-ring detection.
- Use careful validation (time-split, sequential validation), realistic synthetic data augmentation, and continuous monitoring for data drift and concept drift.
- Prioritize data privacy, regulatory compliance (e.g., explainability for regulated domains), and adversarial robustness.

What follows:
1) Architecture & components
2) Data & features
3) Models & where GenAI is used
4) Training / evaluation plan & metrics
5) Deployment & monitoring
6) Security, privacy & compliance
7) Example repo files: README, pipeline skeleton, prompt templates, evaluation checklist

---- 1) Architecture & components (high level)
- Ingest: streaming transactions (Kafka/Kinesis) + batch historical store (S3 / data lake).
- Feature store: online + offline (Feast, Hopsworks, or homemade).
- Models:
  - Real-time scoring: lightweight classifier for latency-sensitive blocking/decline decisions.
  - Async risk scoring: heavier models (GNNs, ensemble) for human review/alerting.
  - GenAI assistant: takes aggregated context and provides explanations, triage recommendations, possible fraudulent rationale, and generates synthetic cases for model augmentation.
- Feedback loop: investigator decisions, chargebacks, and labels go back to training store.
- Orchestration: Airflow / Prefect pipelines for training; Kubernetes for serving.
- Monitoring: data-drift, feature-drift, model performance, fairness metrics, latency, cost.

---- 2) Data & features
Essential data:
- Transaction data: txn_id, timestamp, amount, currency, merchant_id, merchant_category, acquirer, card_id/account_id, card_present boolean, device_id, ip_address, geolocation, channel (web/mobile/atm), authorization_response, BIN (bank id), MCC.
- Customer profile: account_open_date, KYC status, risk_score, historical_avg_txn_amount, velocity counts (txns in last 1h/24h/7d), typical merchant categories.
- Device & network: device fingerprint, user agent, connection_type.
- External signals: sanctions/blacklists, chargeback history, issuer-provided signals.
- Payment lifecycle events: auth attempts, reversal, settlement, chargeback.

Feature ideas (feature store):
- Time features: txn_hour_of_day, txn_day_of_week, time_since_last_txn.
- Aggregates: rolling_count_1h, rolling_sum_24h, distinct_merchants_7d.
- Behavioral embeddings: sequence embeddings (transformer/LSTM) of recent transactions.
- Graph features: node degree (card/account/device), community membership, shortest-path to known-fraud nodes.
- Categorical encoding: target encoding for merchant_id, mcc with smoothing, frequency encoding for device_id.
- Geolocation distance: Haversine distance between billing and transaction geo.
- Risk heuristics: mismatched country/currency, BIN-country mismatch, velocity rule triggers.

Labeling:
- Use confirmed fraud (chargebacks, confirmed investigations) as positive labels.
- Add weak labels (heuristic rules) for initial bootstrap with care (noisy).
- Keep label creation timestamp to support time-aware training.

---- 3) Models & where GenAI helps
Core supervised models (production):
- Light real-time: XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost or small neural net served with low latency for inline decisions.
- Batch/async: larger XGBoost ensembles, deep MLPs, sequence models, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for link/fraud ring detection.
- Unsupervised anomaly detectors: isolation forest, autoencoders, density models for novel fraud patterns.
- Graph models: use PyTorch Geometric or DGL to model account-device-merchant graphs.

GenAI roles (value-add, risky areas noted):
- Feature engineering assistant: use a GenAI model (e.g., LLM) to analyze feature distributions, suggest interactions/aggregates, and generate feature-creation code snippets.
- Synthetic data generation: conditional synthetic transaction generation using a controlled GenAI model or conditional VAE/GAN to augment rare fraud classes. Ensure realistic constraints and include provenance flags.
- Explainability & analyst assistant: LLM summarizes why a transaction was flagged (given model outputs and feature attributions like SHAP), suggests next investigation steps, and drafts case narratives for investigators.
- Triage & prioritization: LLM consumes structured signals + historical outcomes to prioritize cases for human review.
- Pattern discovery: use LLMs to scan analyst notes, case narratives, and logs to propose emerging schemes and mapping to transaction features (use as assistive intelligence).
Caveats: Do not let LLM directly approve declines on high-risk flows without human-in-the-loop. LLM hallucinations are possible â€” always ground LLM outputs in model signals and raw data.

Example hybrid flow:
- Real-time transaction -> real-time classifier -> score.
- If score in uncertain range, call GenAI assistant with feature explanation and investigative suggestions, open a human-review alert with the synthesized narrative.
- High score -> automated decline/hold (policy-driven) and async enrichment + investigator alert.

---- 4) Training, evaluation & metrics
Evaluation methodology:
- Use time-based train/validation/test splits (no leakage). For example: train up to T0, validation T0..T1, test T1..T2.
- Use rolling-window backtesting to simulate model aging.
- Calibrate thresholds on business metrics (precision at X% recall) and expected cost (false accept cost vs false reject cost).
- Use label delay simulation: new fraud labels arrive with delay; ensure training mirrors production label delays.

Core metrics:
- AUC-ROC, PR-AUC (precision-recall more relevant for imbalanced data).
- Precision@k or recall@k, depending on triage capacity.
- False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR).
- Financial metrics: expected loss reduction, total $ saved, cost of false positives (lost revenue, customer churn).
- Latency, throughput for real-time model.
- Explainability quality: human reviewer acceptance of LLM explanations (qualitative), and flag hallucinations.

Testing:
- Adversarial tests: simulate attackers changing behavior (velocity bursts, device spoofing).
- Stress test with synthetic fraud scenarios.
- Test fairness: measure error rates across demographic groups if available.

---- 5) Deployment & monitoring
Serving:
- Real-time: serve a low-latency model with feature-store lookups, prefer gRPC/HTTP endpoint, autoscaling, and caching for repeated lookups.
- Batch: score nightly or hourly for non-latency use-cases.

Monitoring & feedback:
- Data drift detection (population stats), feature distribution drift, model performance drift.
- Feedback ingestion pipeline: investigator labels, chargebacks, merchant disputes.
- Retraining triggers: automatic trigger on performance degradation or scheduled (e.g., weekly) retrain.
- Model explainability: store SHAP values and LLM explanation outputs for audits.

Operational safety:
- Canary deploys, shadow mode to compare new model decisions vs baseline before full rollout.
- Reject list & manual overrides: safety policies to prevent models from generating unacceptable outcomes.
- Rate-limited automated actions for newly-trained models.

---- 6) Security, privacy & compliance
- Minimize PII exposure in prompts to GenAI. Use pseudonymization or hashed identifiers; provide only necessary features.
- If using 3rd-party LLM APIs, ensure data residency and contractual commitments (e.g., no store or reuse) and consider hosting models on-prem or VPC.
- Logging: maintain audit trails for scores, decisions, and LLM outputs.
- Explainability & regulatory: keep rule-based fallback for auditable decisions and provide feature-attribution rationales.
- Adversarial resistance: regular red-teaming of models and mock-attack simulations.

# Fraud Detection for Financial Transactions using GenAI + ML

This repository contains a starter blueprint for building a fraud detection system that combines classical ML, graph models, and Generative AI (LLMs) for feature engineering, synthetic data generation, and analyst assistance.

Contents:
- architecture.md: high-level architecture and components.
- fraud_pipeline.py: pipeline skeleton for feature creation, model training, and inference.
- prompt_templates.md: safe prompt templates for LLM-based assistant tasks (explanations, triage, synthetic generation).
- evaluation_checklist.md: evaluation, monitoring, and deployment checklist.

Security note: Do not send raw PII or unredacted identifiers to third-party LLM APIs. Use hashing/pseudonymization.

Getting started:
1. Populate data in data/transactions.csv (example format described in architecture.md).
2. Configure feature store & model infra (see notes in architecture.md).
3. Run `python fraud_pipeline.py --mode train` to run an end-to-end local prototype.

```markdown name=prompt_templates.md
``` 
(Use the templates below when calling an LLM. ALWAYS remove or hash PII fields, and include provenance and grounding data.)
Template: LLM analyst explanation (structured)
System: "You are a financial fraud analyst assistant. Answer concisely and cite feature values provided. Do not hallucinate facts."

User: 
"Context:
- Model score: {score} (0-1)
- Top 5 SHAP attributions: {shap_top5}  # e.g. [('txn_24h_count', +0.35), ...]
- Transaction features: {features_dict}  # hashed ids, amounts, times
- Historical flags: {historical_flags}

Tasks:
1) Explain in 2-3 sentences why this transaction seems fraudulent, grounded in attributions.
2) Suggest 3 concrete investigation steps (data sources or checks).
3) Provide a confidence (low/medium/high) and the three main reasons for that confidence."

Template: Synthetic fraud case generator (for augmentation)
"Generate {n} synthetic transaction records that match the following conditional constraints: {constraints}. Output as CSV lines with these columns: timestamp, amount, currency, merchant_category, account_cluster_id (pseudonymized), device_hash, is_fraud. Ensure realistic distributions and no PII. Add a short rationale line describing the fraud pattern for each example."

Safety: Append "If any requested output could reveal PII or permit re-identification, refuse and explain what needs to change."
```

```markdown name=evaluation_checklist.md
``` 
- Data splits: Ensure time-based split; simulate label delays.
- Metrics: PR-AUC, Precision@k, False Accept cost, financial uplift.
- Backtesting: rolling windows & canary runs in shadow mode for 2-4 weeks.
- Explainability: store SHAP & LLM explanations; sample 100 LLM outputs for human audit monthly.
- Drift: monitor PSI for each feature; set retraining thresholds.
- Security: redact PII in prompts; ensure model logs are access-controlled.
```

---- Next steps
- If you want, I can:
  - Generate a runnable notebook that builds a small simulated dataset and trains a LightGBM baseline including SHAP explanations and an example LLM prompt call (with placeholders).
  - Create pre-built prompts for specific cases (e.g., money-muling detection, card-not-present fraud).
  - Propose a production rollout checklist and feature-store schema JSON.

Which of those would you like me to produce next (pick one or propose another)?
